React Accelerator Technical excercise

The page is only built with HTML, CSS, Javascript.

I have used arrow functions, Conditional (ternary) operator, several types of events and etc.

Header -- I used two events for header. First one is scroll event which has two function. First is for Laptop version and second is mobile version. Also i used window resize event for change the event function according to the user's screen size.

Courses cards -- I've created data.js to store course card information. I created 1 card model using Template literals and rendered it with a forEach loop.

Slider -- The slide has 2 modes. It uses fade effect for desktop user and normal slide for mobile user. I also used the window resize event to remove the fading effect for the mobile version. I also used the (touchstart, touchmove, touchend) events to swipe the mobile version.
